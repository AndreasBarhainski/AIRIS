# Progress: AIRIS

## What Works

- Comprehensive parameter input system with support for multiple types (string, number, boolean, enum, seed, file)
- Special handling for seed parameter with multiple modes (fixed, random, increase, decrease)
- Advanced image handling implementation:
  - FileInput component with preview functionality
  - File size validation (10MB limit)
  - Error handling and clear functionality
  - Integration with ParameterInput system
  - Tabbed interface for image selection:
    - Generated Images tab for outputs
    - ComfyUI Images tab for inputs
  - Direct upload to ComfyUI input directory
  - Centralized image management with Zustand store
  - Successful LoadImage node integration:
    - Correct parsing of ComfyUI's object_info response
    - Access to available input images
    - Image accessibility verification
- Improved layout and styling:
  - 400px sidebar width
  - Parameter-focused organization (seed first, others alphabetically)
  - Full-width inputs with labels above
  - Enhanced Generate button styling
  - Responsive image preview with proper styling
  - Styled image library dropdown with filtering
  - Tabbed interface with smooth transitions
- Responsive design with proper spacing and mobile support
- Modular CSS architecture with separate files per component
- Backend and frontend logic for sending workflows to ComfyUI and retrieving generated images
- Real-time progress tracking for image generation using WebSockets
- Global progress bar in the frontend, with a clean UI (no percentage display)
- End-to-end image generation and progress updates are functional
- Generate view streamlined to use configuration-referenced workflows
- Image library integration with ComfyUI:
  - Separate tabs for generated and input images
  - Direct upload to ComfyUI input directory
  - Preview functionality for all images
  - API integration for fetching available images
  - Automatic refresh after uploads
  - Correct parsing of LoadImage node structure

## What's Left to Build

- Image deletion functionality for both generated and input images
- Further refinements to parameter input interface based on user feedback
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback throughout the app
- Complete persistent storage for workflows and configurations
- Additional UI/UX improvements for Generate, Images, and Editor sections
- Workflow import and configuration management implementation
- Image metadata management improvements

## Current Status

- Parameter input interface significantly improved and refined
- Image handling functionality fully implemented with core features
- LoadImage node integration successfully completed
- Project continues in implementation and refinement phase
- Core image generation and progress tracking functionality working well
- ComfyUI integration enhanced with direct image management

## Known Issues

- None critical; ongoing refinement and testing
