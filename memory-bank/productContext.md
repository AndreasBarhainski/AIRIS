# Product Context: AIRIS

## Why AIRIS Exists

ComfyUI workflows are powerful but lack an intuitive frontend for managing workflows, parameters, and generated images. AIRIS bridges this gap by providing a user-friendly interface for workflow configuration, execution, and result management.

## Problems Solved

- Simplifies the process of importing and configuring ComfyUI workflows.
- Makes parameter selection and editing accessible to non-technical users.
- Centralizes management of generated images and workflow configurations.

## How It Should Work

- Users import workflow JSON files and manage them within AIRIS.
- Users create and edit configurations for each workflow, selecting which parameters are exposed in the Generate section.
- The Generate section allows users to adjust selected parameters and trigger image generation.
- All generated images are saved and can be browsed in the Images section.

## User Experience Goals

- Clear navigation between Generate, Images, and Editor.
- Minimal steps to import, configure, and run workflows.
- Immediate feedback and loading states during image generation.
- Easy access to all generated images and their metadata.
